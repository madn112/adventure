            As you Enter several Guards block your path with Pikes the Officer sees you and waves them down to let you

            "So you two must be who got sent to help us out" the officer scratches his head in confusion, "I am not
            entirely sure why they sent two advendturers to help a command post patrol the forest but who knows?" "It is
            because" you pipe up "their is an evil lurking in these forests and we need to find the entity and kill it."
            "Is that so? What are we facing I already lost two men to the skeletons what could be worse?" "A king"
            Onthalla responds "Of what?" "Liches" The Officer stumbles backwards in horror "How are we supposed to fight
            it with only 90 men when it is literally death."
        </p>
        <p class="brook">That is where we come in you and your men will fight the zombies that surround the Lich King at
            all times while Onthalla and I fight him." "But but" the officer stammers "I will not have you refusing an
            order from the Empress" Onthalla Proclaims we are fighting the Lich King or the Whole world will end.</p>
