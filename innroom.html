            assume he's drunk or something and continue upstairs.

        <p class="brook">
            You and Onthalla head into the room, Onthalla strips off her armour and gets in bed wearing nothing but a
            Loincloth, you strip to boxers and get in bed too.
        </p>
        <p class="brook">You start to fall asleep when you hear a knock at the door quietly without waking Onthalla you
            open the door and find a guard standing there.</p>
        <p class="brook">The guard tells you that the Towns Magistrate has requested you and your companion and that you
            should head there at first light, yousay thank you close the door then climb back into bed.</p>
