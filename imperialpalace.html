        <h1 class="wrong-way">Imperial City of Dragoncrag Rock</h1>
        <p class="adventurer">
            You walk in with two Imperial Royal Vanguards beside you and Onthalla and 5 Behind you.
        </p>
        <p class="brook">
            You approach Empress Vaermina and Bow down before her "Rise!" she says "I don't like it when people bow
            makes me feel awkward like I'm obligated to say something important." "Sorry your highness." "It's fine but
            now you know, now what is it you are here for." you start to speak, "Well your highne-" Onthalla interupts
            "We were in the Village near Caeperna when the elder asked us to take care of some goblins we did but when
            we returned the elder and villagers were dead." you continue, "We saw a note read it and decided to leave,
            the Note basically read be careful who you mess with and was signed by the Lich King."
        </p>
        <p class="brook">The Empress looks visably shaken by the name Lich King, "We were on the road heading towards
            the Aderisian capital when our other Companion fought us and betrayed us." "So you were heading towards
            Aderisa but that's to the South East." "Yes your Majesty we were heading that way when we decided it would
            be best to go a different direction to confuse anyone tracking us. We made it to Dragonwall and met up with
            my old friend Markallo." Empress Vaermina responds, "My Magistrate Markallo sent you here?" You and Onthalla
            nod affirmatively. "So then what has he sent you to ask?" Onthalla replies, "To send some Legions to defend
            any towns and villages near borders or forests as he thinks those are the more likely to be attacked by the
            Lich King." "Hmm... very well. ARTINO!" "Yes your Ladyship" "Have an inkwell, quill, and paper ready in my
            chambers to write to General Verbosa." "Yes Your Ladyship" she turns to you and Onthalla "As for you two I
            will have a guest chamber set up for you and your lady. You two will be my scouts on the front line so I
            want you to go to the Armoury and get some better Weapons."</p>
