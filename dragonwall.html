        <h1 class="wrong-way">Town Hall</h1>
        <p class="adventurer">
            You and Onthalla wake up and get dressed and ready to go.
        </p>
        <p class="brook">
            You and Onthalla walk the town until you reach a lavishly decorated hall and instantly realize that is where
            you are needed
        </p>
        <p class="brook">As you approach you are hailed by two pike guards who ask you to please enter.</p>
        <p class="brook">As you and Onthalla enter you hear a familiar voice, "Ah Welcome, my friend!" you follow the
            voice until you see your old childhood friend Markallo. "Ah Welcome welcome, oh where are my manners you
            have had a long journey and only just now reached my humble hall." he says, "Yes sir I am Onthalla we have
            just come a long way from a village that was ransacked by something called the Lich King." "Hmm? How
            troubling I will send word by Carrier Pigeon immediately to the Emperor so he can send a few legions to help
            defend the towns and villages." he pauses, "Ah but you my friend it has been forever since we ran and played
            in the streets or Nugarh Vagh how have you been." you shrug "Could be better I guess our other companion a
            man named Markus had betrayed the two of us and so we had no choice but to kill him." "Well not every
            adventurer has been out for the good of people but nevermind that tell me why have you come all this
            from..?" "We just came from Caeperna." "Caeperna you say? hmm... very well what did this Lich King want?"
            Onthalla starts "Well we had apparently killed his minions goblins sir. We had been sent on a quest by the
            village elder to take care of them." You continue to recount the tale and at the end Markallo stands up
            leads you outside and takes you to the stable. "Take these my fastest horses you must go quickly and go to
            the Imperial City my message to the Emperor shall say you are coming and to let you through." "Thank You."
            You and Onthalla say in unison as you mount the horses.</p>
