        After you hear the rustling of the leaves you ask who's there you get no response but hear the rasp of a blade sliding from the scabbard
      </p>
      <p class="brook">Before you can respond with your own steel your attacker stabs you 2 times in the leg you reach out only to see Markus standing there with his blade with your blood on it.</p>
