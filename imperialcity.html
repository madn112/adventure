        <p class="adventurer">
            As you head into the Imperial City you hear merchants in every direction shouting to passersby to purchase
            their wares, as you walk around completely lost you bump into some guards who act suprised then realize that
            you are lost. "Never been to the Imperial City huh?" "No Sir." you reply "Well where are you heading."
            Onthalla chimes in "The Imperial Palace sir Our frind the magistrate of Dragonwall sent us here."
            "Dragonwall... well then we will escort you to the Palace."
        </p>
        <p class="brook">
            Eventually the Guards lead you to a large building with radiant pillars and buttresses and Imperial Flags
            waving about.
        </p>
        <p class="brook">The Royal Vanguard troops protecting the palace and tell you to halt. "Please Sirs we need to
            see the Empress the matter is urgent." "Very Well but keep your arms in the Chest in the Guards Barracks."
            You and Onthalla do as asked and walk into the Palace.</p>
