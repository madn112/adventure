            Your ambush was nearly a success as you notice more enemy troops you decide the best course of action stay
            in the trees and fire down upon the skeleton warriors. The skeletons fire back with arrow and bow and as you
            and the scouts weave your way through the trees Onthalla drops down killing two skeletons and continues to
            fight, "We need to aim carefully, we don't need a stray shot entering Onthalla!" "Yes Sir" as you continue
            firing you notice something in the distance "CANNON!" one of the scouts shout. You need to get out of the
            tree fast before it gets obliterated. Onthalla has dispatched the skeleton cannon crew quickly as you fire a
            few more shots.

            You fire one last shot into the enemy and the last of the undead soldiers fall.
        </p>
        <p class="brook">You look at the dead undead with a smile on your face, you did good the enemy won't stand a
            chance.</p>
