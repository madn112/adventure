        As you walk with Onthalla she asks "Do you think Markus is a bit
        overbearing?" You reply with a shrug of indifference, "Well I think that
        he can be a bit overbearing when it comes to rest, what with his always
        just grabbing the nearest bed and falling down in it."
      </p>
      <p class="brook">
        Again you shrug indifferently but then speak, "Well I guess he just
        needs his beauty rest." Onthalla laughs at this she then returns to her
        usual stoic demeanor.
      </p>
      <p class="brook">
        She looks at you thoughtfully and then turns around to see Markus
        standing there. "Eep" shrieks Onthalla "Markus what are you doing here"
        Markus replies, "Looking for you two. I met with the village elder and
        he says they have been having a goblin problem I will head out and just
        stand guard at the village entrance and wait for you two to find food
        then find the inn."
      </p>
      <h3 class="brook">
        <strong>You find the Market but it's really huge.</strong>
      </h3>
      <p class="brook">
        It almost looks like the bazaars of
        <span class="country">Aderisa</span>. You and Onthalla look around and
        find a good market stall, "Hello My good stallkeep." you start out as
        you look down and see a Tiefling. "The name's Zekaria" she spits out
        "What do you want." Onthalla replies "Just some meats and fruits ma'am."
        The tiefling looks up at her and says "That'll be 15 gold pieces." You
        grab the coin pouch and count out 14 gold pieces and 5 silver pieces.
        "Here you go!" Zekarias demeanor changed from pissy to cheerful in a
        split second but without a moments hesitation Onthalla grabs your arm in
        hers and the two of you head out to find and inn.

        The Country of Aderisa is on the Southern Borders of Aderitrem of which
        it broke off from.

      <h3>Castles</h3>
      <p>
        There are various castles amongst the Kingdom of Aderisa the famous of
        which is Fortress Cainfield when in 243 B.G. (Before Gunpowder) the
        battle of Cainfield took place between the forces of Cain and his
        soldiers of Aderisa and Abel and his soldiers of Aderitrem. Abel who was
        the military commander of the Aderitrem was trying to put down the
        rebellion started by his brother Cain. During the Battle an arrow loosed
        by Cain struck Abel in the heart and he died there instantly. Upon
        seeing their commander fall in battle the forces of the Aderitrem routed
        and fell back all the way to the capital of Aldwald.
