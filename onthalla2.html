      As you and Onthalla leave the tent you spot a gleaming light like that of a mirror or a blade then you look up and
      you see Markus leaning against a tree.
    </p>
    <p class="brook">
      "What are you doing out of your tent Markus?" you ask, "Funny I was going to ask the same thing." replies Markus.
      Onthalla looks over to see a sheath on the ground and instantly pulls out her blade.
    </p>
    <p class="brook">"Oh finally took notice huh?" replies Markus and just as the fire flickers you see a faint glimmer
      of a smirk on Markus' face you pull out your sword prepared for a 2 on 1 duel but Markus puts his blade in the
      ground. "Fight me with your fists." says Markus, you nod to Onthalla and she leaves into the brush you gently set
      down your sword in sheath and raise your fists defensively.</p>
    <p class="brook">As you are fighting Markus you notice Onthalla behind him you start grunting and hitting harder to
      mask any noise Onthalla makes and after your last blow Onthallas blade pierces Markus back. You leave him lying
      bleeding and dying you decide the only safe thing to do is to leave your stuff but slash things and make it look
      like Markus nearly killed you and Onthalla.</p>
