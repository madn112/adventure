            You and Onthalla walk into the Inn making sure that no sign has your wanted posters after checking around
            and finding nothing you and Onthalla walk up to the front desk.
        </p>
        <p class="brook">
            You walk up to the desk arm in arm with Onthalla and ask for a room for one night.
        </p>
        <p class="brook">The Lady at the desk hands you and Onthalla a piece of paper with info written on it, you and
            Onthalla read it and both of your hearts skip a beat as you both start blushing.</p>
        <p class="brook">The information sheet you were just handed seemed ordinary at first as it reads couples stay one night in one
            room showers are downstairs to the right bathrooms to the left we don't care what you do in the rooms and
            don't care if you just got married and want to make it steamy. So you and Onthalla head upstairs to get ready for tommorow.</p>
