        As you walk back to the village you notice the village elder standing
        there unmoving.

      <p class="brook">
        As you exit the forest thickets you smell a mixture of blood and death
        wafting from the village. Someone burned the village down but who as you
        approach the Smoke in the sky from the burning village billows.
      </p>
      <p class="brook">
        You approach the dead elder whos body had been pinned to the wall by
        crossbow bolt and sword and a small note pinned to the wall. It reads
        "<span class="bold"> Dear adventurers did you think I would not notice that you killed all
          my goblin servants and underlings you will bring death and destruction
          to whichever Town or city you visit be careful who you mess
          with.","Who's it from?" Onthalla asks, "It says it came from the Lich King." you reply.</span>
