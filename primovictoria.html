            The 90 Men have Marched with you to just outside the Command Post, on the other side of the field you see
            about 1.000 skeleton warriors this battle seems like it will be a last stand.
        </p>
        <p class="brook">
            The 1.000 skeletons are charging at you peacemeal so it should be easy to kill them all, "Aim for the Heads
            it's a bigger target!" the officer yells, the Pikemen moved forward pikes lowered and the Musketiers have
            aimed at the skeletons, you are among them and Onthalla is in front of the Pikes.
        </p>
        <p class="brook">With a Great big Crash of steel and bone the skeletons hit the pikes some die instantly "Hold
            fire Hold Fire!" "FIRE!" about 15 skeleton warriors go down and still more are being held back by the pikes
            as you see undead horsemen circle around you aim your pistol at one and hit it in the head the skeleton and
            horse dissapate.</p>
        <p class="brook">Your troops have nearly fought them off losing only two men to their wounds. You keep the pressure up against
            the enemy troops and force the rest to flee you and the men let out a Cheer as the battle has been one now
            forward march</p>
