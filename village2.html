            <h1>The Empire of Mandeiras</h1>
            <p>
                The Empire of Mandeiras is on western edge of the Sea of Storms it's capital Dragoncrag Rock is near
                the Bay of Eels established near the year 0 B.G. The Kingdom of Mandeiras is one of the oldest Kingdoms
                in the world. Despite this it's Army is still reeling from it's major defeat at the Battle of Baronbone
                Briar against the Elvish armies of <span class="country">Adwendagan</span> It's Merchant fleets the
                largest in the world
                but constantly onslaughted by the Massive warships of Adwendagan causing them to lose more ships to
                pirates and privateers. On land as well the Kingdom deals with rogues and rebels who surround their
                capital. These are why the other Kingdoms call Mandeiras the Old Man Kingdom due to it's slow rather
                than sudden collapse.

            <h3>Lineage of Emperors</h3>
            <p>
                The Lineage of Emperors after the Great Founding of Mandeiras goes as
                follows:
            </p>
            <h4>
                Emperor Mandeiras Marticio I Reigned 12th of Morndal 0 BG to 15th of Morndal 80 BG before being
                assassinated by religious zealots of the <span class="country">Cult of Kosmosimi</span>
            </h4>
            <h4>
                Emperor Manderio Marticio I Reigned from 81 BG after retaking the Capital from the Cult of Kosmosimi to
                140 BG before dying peacefully in his sleep he willed the Kingdom to his younger and to his older he
                willed the wealth he had attained to go create his own Kingdom.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                Empress Mintalio Marticio I Reigned from 140 BG to 200 BG she never got married but had one female
                Bastard who she admitted was hers and gave her heirship.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                Empress Mintalio Marticio II Reigned from 200 BG to 248 BG she was killed by a disgruntled servant who
                had
                killed off the main lineage of Marticio Emperors and after that dark day the Cadet branches of the
                Marticios took over and soon civil war was upon the Empire.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                Emperor Silvestro D'Agostino Reigned 248 BG to 300 BG he was killed in the streets of Dragoncrag Rock by
                an angry mob of Aderisian refugee's.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                Emperor Carlo D'Agostino Reigned 300 BG to 1 AG he thought he was safe on the tower walls away from the
                battle for his kingdom but a stray bullet lodged in his throat killing him near instantly
            </h4>
            <p>
                After Emperor Carlo D'Agostino something now known as the War of the Asters. Asters were the royal
                symbol of the D'Agostinos and the Asters and the Agostos. This was a three way Civil War in the empire
                between the Cadet branches of the former Marticio Emperors. The war was bloody and loud as gunpowder had
                been discovered by Imperial scientists about 1 year earlier and although other Kingdoms and Republics
                didn't know about the invention yet they would as the war eventually spanned the entire world engulfing
                it all in Fire and Sword. Eventually the Emperor that came out on top was the Asters and their Elven
                allies in the winning Siege of Dragoncrag Rock.
            </p>
            <p>
                So far only the Asters remain as the other branches either died in battle from disease or from
                assassination or suicide. The Asters are now no longer a cadet branch and are now the Main Imperial
                leaders but under a Matron lineage where only females could rule.
            </p>
            <h4>Our current Empress, Empress Vaermina Asters has been Regining from 6 AG to present and while her reign has been relatively
                peaceful war looms over the horizon as I fear our world maybe larger than once thought.</h4>
            <h3>Castles</h3>
            <p>
                There are many Castles and Fortresses under the control of the Empire with the most famous being the
                Castle of Baronbone Briar where the war against the Elves was fought and won.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Castle Baronbone Briar</li>
                <li>Castle Dragonbone</li>
                <li>Castle Nilos</li>

                <li>Fortress Misthios</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cities</h3>
            <p>
                The Cities are as old as the world could remember although the world is older than just 0 Before
                Gunpowder it was mainly just tribes and not cities. The only city larger than Dragoncrag Rock is the
                city of Dragonbourne with a population of about 1.6 Million and a size of 1200 Sq. Kilomarteres.
            </p>

            <p>The City of Dragoncrag Rock is protected by the Emerald Vanguards but the Emperors are protected by the
                Royal Assassins a group of assassins dedicated to protecting the Emperors and Empresses </p>
            <h3>Towns and Villages</h3>
            <p>
              The Towns and villages are older than the cities becoming more modernized when the Age of Sword began.
